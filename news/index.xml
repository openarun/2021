      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been about 3 months after I published post &amp;ldquo;Looking for organizers&amp;rdquo;. Last 3 months, many Ubuntu Local communities and other FLOSS communities contact me to join Ubucon Asia 2021 team. Today, We have 12 host communities from 10 different regions in the team. Some organizers from those communities with excellent experience with organizing international events also joined our team.
And with this Ubucon Asia 2021 team, We&amp;rsquo;ve been made many progress until now.</description>
